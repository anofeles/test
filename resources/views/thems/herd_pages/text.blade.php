<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The aim of eDrone proposal is to define a learning
        environment to deliver more opportunities to access new competences related to the use
        of drone technologies in professional activities.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These new competences refer in particular to the use of advanced
    ICT solutions for the use of drones and of the data acquired through drones that may go a
    long way towards the goals and priorities in terms of optimization of the professional
    competences, that have already been stated in the <strong>Social-economic Development
        Strategy 2020</strong> of all the <strong>Parter Countries</strong>, and in terms of
    creating new job opportunities, especially for youth that is strongly encouraged by <strong>Europe
        2020 strategy</strong> as stated in the <strong>European Commission Communication
        &ldquo;Youth on the Move&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The use of drones by professionals will open new scenarios
    requiring practical and theoretical knowledge that are beyond the simple driving and
    mantainance of drones:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">(i) drone mechanical characteristics,</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">(ii) sensing equipment,</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">(iii) processing and use of the acquired information, and
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">(iv) national and local laws regulating their use.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The main objective of the eDrone project is to provide
        higher education institutions in the Partner Countries with effective and efficient
        instruments to setup Offices for Education for Drones (OED), for the transferring of all
        the above mentioned knowledges to professionals of each Partner Country.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the project aims at realizing an innovative ICT-based
    infrastructure employing enhanced technologies and methodologies allowing all the Partner
    Countries to create a network for sharing educational contents and databases to
    professionals. Such infrastructure will be used to support OED in the technological and
    scientific transfer to professionals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Programme Countries will transfer their know-how and
        expertise for the achievement of the eDrone objectives by training the future teachers
        of the OED and by supporting them in the first edition of the OED.</strong></p>
